# DataLens - A Visual Studio Code Extension for API Data Visualization

DataLens is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to fetch and visualize data from APIs in a clean, collapsible tree structure. Whether you're working with JSON or XML, DataLens makes it easy to explore the structure of API responses right within your editor.

## Features

- **Fetch API Data**: Input a URL through the command palette, and DataLens will fetch and display the API's response.
- **Collapsible Data Structure**: Visualize nested data structures (objects and arrays) with collapsible tree elements, making it easier to explore large datasets.
- **Object and Array Identification**: See clear indicators for objects and arrays, with arrows showing expandable sections.
- **Supports JSON and XML**: DataLens can handle both JSON and XML responses, automatically converting XML to JSON for consistency.
